# Kubernetes
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a big deal, and is something that I enjoy using.

I have decided to document my kubernetes setup so that other folks can follow along and see what I have 
going on, and maybe learn a thing or two along the way.  It is also documented because I tend to rebuild
the mess every couple of months and I usually forget something along the way!

## Order of Operations
* [Installation](installation.md)
* [Local Setup](local_setup.md)
* [Add Worker Node](add_worker.md)
* [Certificate Manager](certmanager.md)
* [NFS Provisioner](nfs_provisioner.md)
* [Metrics Server](metrics_server.md)
