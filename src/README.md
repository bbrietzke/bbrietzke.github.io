# Introductions
 
So this is my collection of thoughts, ideas and craziness documented for everyone to see.  I have a lot of different interests that I cycle through irregularly.  It's hard to keep track of the bits and pieces so I figure I should write some of this down.

I don't like blogging, much to much like trying to keep a journal or a dairy ( not that there is anything wrong in that ).  Instead I have specific, task-focused documents that I want to keep around so that when I revisit a topic, I can pick up where I left off.

If others find my documents and notes of interest, then that's great.  That is not the reason why I'm doing this though.

If folks have suggestions or corrections, then great!  Create a fork, branch and submit a PR.  I don't mind being corrected and giving credit where credit is due.  I'm not right all the time and there are much more knowledgable folks out there then me.
