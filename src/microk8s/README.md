# Introduction

MicroK8s is a great single-node kubernetes distribution.  It allows a very compact and customizable
package that also gives you full power of kubernetes.  If you have older hardware at your disposal, or a 
virtual machine from Parallels or Virtual Box you can setup a kubernetes machine for testing or doing 
development against.
